Transfer Learning
YounessGPT wants to learn and get closer to being the first AGI. So, to do that, he tried to use transfer 
learning technique. Transfer learning is a technique used in Machine Learning where a model trained on one 
task is reused or adapted for another related task. In transfer learning, the knowledge gained from solving one 
problem is leveraged to solve a different but related problem. To do that, he wants to collect the maximum possible 
information about different problems. So, he asked the headmaster of ENSEM to give him the marks of the first 2 students 
in ENSEM. But he got confused about who he will choose to help him. As his best friend, he asked you to help him decide that. 
You are given 2 lists that represent the marks of the 1st and 2nd student respectively. Your task is to print 0 if the average marks 
of the first student are bigger than the 2nd one, 1 if the 2nd student got more, or -1 otherwise.

Input:
t: the number of test cases
n: the length of the arrays
The next 2 lines contain a and b, the marks of the 1st and 2nd student respectively.

Output:
The answer to YounessGPT's problem.
