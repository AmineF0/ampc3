# Buvette

YounessGPT is frequent customer of the restaurant "l'buvette" in ENSAM (don't ask me how or why). 
He noticed a huge amount of purchases being made, so he got curious how much "l'buvette" gains each day.

He asked the responsible of l'buvette to give him the whole menu, and the purchases made in a day.
The owner gave him the items that they sell and their prize, as well as invoices that document purchases made.
YounessGPT compiled all this purchases in a single list, but since the AI is not smart enough yet, 
he didn't understand that he can sum all the quantity purchased of the items. so he ended up having
multiple occurences of the same item each with a quantity that corresponds to each invoice.

YounessGPT asked for your help to calculate the gains of l'buvette so that he can learn from them.

\input
The test input will contain a number t (1 <= t <= 1e2) , the number of test cases.
Then the first line for each test case contains n (1 <= n <= 1e4) the number of items of the menu and m  (1 <= m <= 1e4) the purchases made in the day.

Followed by n lines, each line contains a string : the name of the item, and p (1 <= p <= 1e4) the price.

Followed by m lines, each line contains a string : the name of the iteÃ¹ and q (1 <= q <= 1e4) the quantity of the item purchased

It must be noted that the length of the item's string name does not exceed 10.

\output
for each test case output a number in a line the amount of gains the restaurant made.
