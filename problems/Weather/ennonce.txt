# Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...

Meknes has a very weird weither, it can at moment be sunny to become stormy.

YounessGPT found an as weird formula to predict the weather:
Quality    = ( 6x-5y+z+5 ) %mod
Pollution  = ( x+y-7 )     %mod
Randomness = ( z-1+x )     %mod
such that mod = 10**9 + 7
apocalyse bla bla

given the the paramters of january of the current year (2024)
find the quality of the weather in january after n years
