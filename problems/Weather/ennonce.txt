# Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...

Meknes has a very weird weither, it can at moment be sunny to become stormy. 

It is making all the citizens confused about what to wear, and no weather prediction seems
to be very accurate.

Some might even speculate that the effect of pollution on weather has became very impactful 
and made the situation even worse. 

That was untill YounessGPT put his mind into it. After some calculations nobody understands other than him,
he found 3 new paramters he uses to describe the weather : Quality, Pollution, Randomness. Even more his new parameters
can see the effect of climate change for a long periode of time.
His predictions were very accurate and he showed them to you. You were amazed by it, 
and wanted to see what meknes will feel like after years, more importantly how much time we still have left before the climate change becomes
catastrophical. 


The werid formula YounessGPT gave you goes as follows, it allows you to predict the weather for the next month:
Quality( month i)    = ( 6*Quality( month i-1)+5Pollution( month i-1)+Randomness( month i-1)+5 ) %mod
Pollution( month i)  = ( Quality( month i-1)+Pollution( month i -1 )+7 )     %mod
Randomness( month i) = ( Quality( month i-1)+Randomness( month i-1)+1 )     %mod
such that mod = 10**9 + 7



So given the the paramters of january of the current year (2024)
find the quality of the weather in january after n years

\input 
The first line contains t <= 100 : the number of test cases
Followed by t lines: each contains the Quality , Pollution, Randomness <= 1e9 for january of this year, and n <=1e9 , the number of years .

\output
Print the Quality of weather of january after n years.
