# Pointage


YounessGPT is looking for the most disciplined students because he wants to understand the impact of discipline on the overall school performance.
ENSAM meknes use a system of "pointage" to track students attendence, and somehow the AI got his hand on it. He exported two types of data :
- students information : a list of the codes and names of the students, one student by line. It must be noted that the code is unique for each student.
- pointage history : a list of tables, where each table contains the code of students who attended.

Example:
Student information
code   name
P12323 jalal
M45644 asmae
P58432 amine

History
session 1 : 3 students
3 P12323 M45644 P58432

session 2 : 2 students
2 P58432 M45644

session 3 : 0 students
0

YounessGPT asked for your help to know the students that attended the most sessions. in case of a tie, print all of them one by line in an increasing order.

\input
the first line contains n : the number of students.
For the following n lines, u will get Code(i) and Name(i), the code and name for the person i.
Then u will get a number m : the number of sessions.
Followed by m lines, each line starts with the a number of students, followed by a unique codes of students that attended.

\ouptut
print the name of students that attended the most sessions. in case of a tie, print all of them one by line in an increasing order.
