# Groups

There is no arts&Metiers without machining and indutrial labs and practices. However due to the limitations
of hardware, and tools and human power, the school can't fit everywhere in the schoolyear in a single big practice session.
Each practice session is costly therefore the number of sessions should be minimal, and we should split people to the minimum number
of groupes possible. 

This is an extremely hard task, since the lab contains m machines, each one can be used by p_i people each session. The machines should
be operated with the supervision of a qualified teacher for the machine, who can't supervise more than S_i student each session.

It must be noted that each session, the students are tasked to use one and only machine while being guided by one and only one supervisor.
It is also worth mentioning that student can use only a machine and has a supervisor in all the practice session and can't give it to 
someone to replace him.
The supervisor can be affected to people from different machines he is qualified to use.

Given the complexity of YounessGPT, he proposed to solve them this problem with your help.

\input
The first line has 3 number, 0 <= n <= 1e10 : the number of students, 0 <= m <= 500 the number of machines, 0 <= s <= 500 : the number of supervisors
The following line contains m number 0 <= p_i <= 100 denoting how many people can use the machine i in a session
Then s number follows in a new line 0 <= s_i <= 100 denoting how many person can the supervisor supervise.
Followed by s lines : each line i starts with a number t denoting the number of machine the ith supervisor can use, followed by the index of those t machines.

Note :
All the indexings starts with 0.

\output
give the miminum numbers of sous groups possible.
