# YounessGPT

GPT learns through text completion by pre-training on vast amounts of text data. 
During pre-training, the model is exposed to sequences of text and is trained to predict the next word or sequence of words given the preceding context. 
This process is often referred to as autoregressive language modeling.

By repeatedly exposing the model to text completion tasks, it learns to understand and generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. 
This allows GPT to exhibit human-like language understanding and generation capabilities across a wide range of tasks and domains.

Thus a new AI called YounessGPT is being created. Your task in this problem is to mimic in someway the result of the YounessGPT.

The AI gets a series of input as words, that are being used to learn. In the learning phase the AI remembers all of them.

In the exploitation phase, the AI is given q queries. It is given the start of the word and the AI is supposed to complete it from the words it learned.

YounessGPT tries to predict correctly the word given from the prefix, so it completes the prefix with the most frequent word in the data used for learning. in case of a tie , it output the smallest one lexicographically.

\input
the first line contains t the number of test classes
The first line in the test case contains a single number n , the number of words,
followed by n lines , each line contain a word that was given to YounessGPT to train.
The following line contains a letter q, the number of queries.
Followed by q lines each contains a prefix that the AI will complete.

\output
for each query output the output of YounessGPT
