YounessGPT has evolved to become an AGI with the ability to create mini AIs. The school tasked him with creating a multitude of AI agents to manage various aspects of school operations.

The AI initiative was highly successful, and YounessGPT emerged as the master of this new AI population residing within the school's network.

The network manager detected suspicious activity: encrypted messages circulating among the AIs. This posed a significant security threat, prompting the security managers to seek your assistance, given your close relationship with YounessGPT, to understand the nature of the potential threat.

The security manager exported a series of integer numbers from the network and provided them to you.

Recalling YounessGPT's admiration for encryption algorithms, you set out to investigate.

The encryption algorithm operates as follows:
Encrypt: Given a number, represent it in binary form and generate n numbers that can be decrypted correctly.
Decrypt: Given a series of numbers represented in binary form (e.g., 10111 1110 11001), the decrypted message is a number where the ith bit is the most common among the ith bits of the given numbers. In case of a tie, it defaults to 1.

\input
The first line contains t ≤ 1e2, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case ti starts with a line containing a number n ≤ 1e5, indicating the count of numbers in the series.
The next line contains those n numbers to decrypt, where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 2**31.

\output
Print a single integer: the decrypted message.
