# -im access to all the datashows, so that he can attend all classes.

To do that they need to connect the YounessGPT server with all the datashows using wires. The problem faced is that the GPT server
two outputs ports, and the number of datashows is big. The technical team in ENSAM got their hands on a very special Switch that play the role of a diffuser.
But this switcher has one flaw, it only has one input and 2 outputs, so we will have to use more than one switch. One can determine the optimal number of switchers
to connect the AI with datashows, but that's a problem for the technical team.

After they solved the issue and connected the system, they had one issue, the AI was not connected to all the datashows.
So they needed your help to determine which switch is damaged. To do that they gave you the schema used in the configuretion.

It is guaranteed that only one component (either the AI or the switches) is broken, the datashows work fine. 
The AI is the root of the system, it can be faulty too, if the AI is faulty , you should print : "AGI is a myth"

\input 
The first line contains a 3 numbers, n, m, k.
n: the number of the datashows, in the rest of the problemthe datashows will be indexed from 0 to n-1
m: the number of switches, in the rest of the problem they will be indexed from 0 to m-1
k: the number of connections in the system.

Followed by k lines, each line contains a letter li, a number ui, a letter lj, a number uk. The letter indicated the type of the componenet:
it can be A: the AI, S: a switch, D: a datashow. it means that the component indexed ui of the type li is connected as an input to the indexed uj component of type lj.

The last line contains a list of datashows that are not accessible.

\output
if the AI is faulty print "AGI is myth". if the problem is in the switch, output its index in its category.
